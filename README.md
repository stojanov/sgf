# Simple Game Framework

This was my hobby project for a long time now, mainly i started it to learn about some game design, c++ and computer graphics. Decided to upload it in case i sometimes need it and possibly work on it in the future.
 It is very bare bones and just a set of tools in order to create simple 2D Graphics. Left this project in order to work on another one with opengl.
 
 #### Some features
 - C++17
 - State Management/Rendering System
 - Asset Managment
 - Custom User Interface Components:
     - Button
     - Dropdown menu
     - Stack Menu
 - Custom Debug/Logging (Very basic just a simple logger and trace mechanism)
 - Some math and sfml vector utiliy functions
 - CPU Perlin Noise both the classic implementation and the improved one([paper](https://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/noise/))
 - Spatial Hash and planned to implement a Quadtree but was unsure of the implementation and needed more research.

Keep in mind that this is not tested and is just a hobby project. Mainly inspired by [Hopson97's Framework](https://github.com/Hopson97/) and some books on sfml game development.
